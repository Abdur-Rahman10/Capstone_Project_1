## 📖 About The Project
This project serves as a foundational digital resume, built entirely with core HTML5 elements. It demonstrates a strong understanding of semantic web structure, multi-page navigation, and accessible document formatting without relying on external CSS or JavaScript.

### ✨ Key Features
* **Multi-Page Architecture:** Features seamless navigation between the main resume (`index.html`), a personal interests page (`hobbies.html`), and a dedicated contact page (`contact.html`).
* **Semantic HTML5:** Built using proper structural tags (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`) for clean, readable code and accessibility.
* **Form Integration:** Includes a structured contact form layout with required input fields for name, email, and messaging.
* **List & Table Formatting:** Effectively uses nested lists to organize education, work experience, and technical skills clearly.

## 📂 Project Structure
* `index.html` - The main resume page detailing my professional summary, internship experience at Tech Solutions Inc., education at HKBK College, and technical skills.
* `hobbies.html` - A dedicated page highlighting my interests outside of work, including hiking and side projects.
* `contact.html` - A functional contact directory featuring my email, LinkedIn, GitHub, and a message form.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
* **HTML5** (Pure structural markup)
